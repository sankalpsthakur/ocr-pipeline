# Noise-Robust OCR Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive noise-robust OCR system to address the catastrophic failure on degraded images (0% confidence on noisy/scaled images). The solution combines JAX-based denoising, Quantization Aware Training (QAT), and adaptive quality routing.

## Problem Addressed
- **Original Issue**: Near 0% confidence on noisy/scaled images
- **DEWA noise results**: 0% confidence on all noise levels (low/medium/high)
- **SEWA scaling**: 0% confidence at 50% scale, 19.7% at 75% scale

## Solution Architecture

### 1. JAX Denoising Adapter (`jax_denoising_adapter.py`)
**Features:**
- Lightweight U-Net architecture (<1M parameters)
- Multi-noise type support (Gaussian, salt-pepper, compression artifacts)
- Patch-based processing for memory efficiency
- Quality classification for intelligent routing
- Target: <50ms preprocessing overhead

**Key Components:**
```python
class LightweightUNet(nn.Module):
    """Features: (16, 32, 64, 128) - reduced for mobile"""
    
class QualityClassifier(nn.Module):
    """Fast quality assessment for routing decisions"""
```

### 2. Synthetic Degradation Generator (`synthetic_degradation.py`)
**Degradation Types:**
- **Noise**: Gaussian, salt-pepper, speckle
- **Blur**: Motion, Gaussian, defocus
- **Compression**: JPEG, WebP artifacts
- **Geometric**: Perspective, rotation, shear
- **Lighting**: Brightness, contrast, shadows
- **Resolution**: Downscaling simulation

**Training Data Generation:**
- Realistic degradation parameters
- Multiple severity levels (low/medium/high)
- Combination degradations (70% probability)

### 3. QAT-Aware Robust Models (`qat_robust_models.py`)
**Features:**
- Quantization Aware Training for mobile deployment
- Built-in noise augmentation during training
- 4-bit/8-bit target quantization
- Noise injection layers for robustness

**Key Innovations:**
```python
class NoiseAugmentationLayer(nn.Module):
    """Adds noise during training for robustness"""
    
class QATRobustTextDetector(nn.Module):
    """Mobile-optimized detector with noise robustness"""
```

### 4. Adaptive OCR Pipeline (`adaptive_ocr_pipeline.py`)
**Intelligent Routing:**
- **High Quality** (>0.8): Direct Tesseract (minimal processing)
- **Medium Quality** (0.5-0.8): Light preprocessing + QAT models
- **Low Quality** (0.2-0.5): JAX denoising + QAT models
- **Very Low** (<0.2): Maximum preprocessing + Tesseract fallback

**Quality Assessment Metrics:**
- Sharpness (Laplacian variance)
- Contrast (standard deviation)
- Noise estimation
- Edge density
- Dynamic range
- Brightness consistency

### 5. Robustness Evaluation Framework (`robustness_evaluation.py`)
**Comprehensive Testing:**
- Before/after comparison
- Multiple degradation types and severity levels
- Statistical significance testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Visualization and reporting

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Noise Resilience
- **Before**: 0% confidence on all noise levels
- **Target**: 70%+ accuracy on noisy images
- **Method**: JAX denoising + quality-aware routing

### Scale Robustness  
- **Before**: 50% scale = 33% accuracy
- **Target**: 50% scale = 80% accuracy
- **Method**: Multi-scale training + adaptive preprocessing

### Processing Speed
- **Overhead**: <50ms preprocessing (JAX optimized)
- **Total Pipeline**: Maintain <2s total processing time
- **Mobile Ready**: QAT models optimized for mobile deployment

### Model Size
- **Denoising Adapter**: ~5MB additional
- **QAT Models**: 25-75% size reduction through quantization
- **Total Footprint**: Target <50MB for complete pipeline

```

### Quality Routing Thresholds
```python

    medium_quality_threshold=0.5,  # Light enhancement  
    low_quality_threshold=0.2,     # Aggressive denoising
    confidence_boost_factor=1.2    # Reward good preprocessing
)
```

### QAT Configuration
```python
